# Data Engineering weave_neo4j
Repo consists of data pipeline which processes xml data to Neo4j

> First of all, it was indeed challenging to go through the data and understanding it, for a person from financial dev background, it was difficult to identify the primary keys and setup the relationships.

## Requirements & Tools
- Use pipenv packaging to install packages
- The pipeline should run on a local machine
- Use open-source tools as much as possible


## Neo4j Target Database
Please run a Neo4j database locally. You can download Neo4j from https://neo4j.com/download-center/ 

### Note:
Apologies for not using Airflow, I read this requirement in the very last moment, if it is a must requirement given an extra day I can implement the pipeline using airflow.
